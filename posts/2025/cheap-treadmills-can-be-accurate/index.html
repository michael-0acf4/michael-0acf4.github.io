<p>I would define cheap with the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Below average price</li>
<li>Purely manual</li>
<li>Noticibly inaccurate (but consistent) measurements</li>
</ul>
<p>Measuring time shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, and one can easily assume it is just as accurate as any time measured on an actual watch.</p>
<p>How do you know if the measurements are consistent?</p>
<p>Everything can be derived from speed and time (calories, total distance).
If your treadmill is telling you some consistent measurement each time you use it over multiple session, each roughly of the same duration, then even if the measurment is completly inacurate, it should be good enough.</p>
<h1 id="some-context">Some context</h1>
<p>I made some experiments and I noticed that within exactly $8 min$, I did $2 km$.</p>
<p>That means I ran at $~ 4.17 m/s$, which is unbelievly fast, too fast! There is just no way I can consistently do $15 km/h$ (the average running speed of a person is around $10 km/h$).</p>
<p>But hey, the measurements are consistents. That means in a way or another I can still work out my actual speed.</p>
<h1 id="effort-and-distance">Effort and distance</h1>
<p>Generally, what you care the most is the distance you went through over a period of time.
But here I want to convince you that what you should actually care about is not distance, but rather the effort you put in.</p>
<p>Surely, it requires more <strong>work</strong> to run through an inclined surface than a flat one right? Yes, obviously.</p>
<p>Running on a treadmill is an intersting case because as you run at an incline angle $\alpha$, over a cumulative distance $D$, at some speed $v$ the height is still the same (not comparable to running uphill).</p>
<p>There must be a force making you go forward that is generated from your muscle and is doing work for you to go forward.</p>
<p>Now, in our model we will study the work $W_{stride}$ for each stride. Then over some distance $d$, over some duration $t$ moving at some speed $v$, it follows:</p>
<p>$$ W_{flat} = \frac {d}{vt} W_{stride} $$</p>
<p>$W_{stride}$ is directly proportional to the effort summoned from your muscles.</p>
<p>This expression is motivated by the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more the units of distance we cover per unit of time to reach $D$, the smaller the work. (higher speed $v$)</li>
<li>The more the units of time we spend walking to cover $D$, the smaller the work. (e.g. $100m$ in an hour is less effort).</li>
<li>There is no real gain in potential energy (we are not going uphill!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Or more generally, at an incline angle $\alpha$, the effective work becomes..
$$ W_{\alpha} = \frac {d}{vt} W_{stride} \cos \alpha $$</p>
<p>The original force making you go forward is now being projected at an inclined line.</p>
<p>At constant speed $v$, it all simplifies even further since $v = \Delta x / \Delta t = d / t$.</p>
<p>$$ W_{flat} = W_{stride} $$
$$ W_{\alpha} = W_{stride} \cos \alpha $$</p>
<p>Work increases proportional to distance, then it follows:</p>
<p>$$ \frac {D_{flat}} {D_{tread}} = \frac {W_{flat}} {W_{tread}} $$
$$ \frac {D_{flat}} {D_{tread}} = \frac {W_{stride}} {W_{stride} \cos \alpha} $$
$$ \frac {D_{flat}} {D_{tread}} = \frac {1} {\cos \alpha} $$
$$ D_{flat} = \frac {1} {\cos \alpha} D_{tread} $$</p>
<p>For example, if I run at constant speed over some period on my treadmill, what is the equivalent distance $D_{flat}$ with the same conditions?</p>
<p>At an incline of 15-degrees ($pi/12$) the factor $ 1 / \cos \alpha \approx 1.03 $, that means there is $ 3\% $ increase in distance.</p>
<p>That means that for $1 km$ on your treadmill, you will have to do $30$ more meters to compensate for the incline when running on a flat ground.</p>
<p>Now getting back to the initial question. I suspect my treadmill due to it being cheap has uninorically more accurate measurements.</p>
<p>It says I did $2000 m$ in $8 min$, to which I suspected that maybe it&rsquo;s accounting for the incline? Hence the over-analyzing work above.</p>
<p>Sadly, at least according to the model, the answer seems to be no, well.. it&rsquo;s cheap after all!</p>
<p>$2000 m - 3\% \times 2000 m = 1940 m$</p>
<p>$1940 m$ in $8$ minutes is still too much!</p>
<p>Ok, at least since my treadmill is consistent in its measurements, and if my true speed estimated speed is $v_{true}$ (I can just count the revolutions by eyes) then at the end of a session I can just do the following calculations:</p>
<p>$$ D_{flat} = v_{true}t = \frac {\beta} {\cos \alpha} D_{tread(FAKE)} $$</p>
<p>With $\beta$ being the overestimation factor, and since I have empirical data, I can just do the following:</p>
<p>$$ v_{true}t = \frac {\beta} {\cos \alpha} D_{tread(FAKE)} \rightarrow {\beta} = v_{true}t \frac {\cos \alpha} {D_{tread(FAKE)}} $$
$$ {\beta} = v_{true}t \frac {\cos \alpha} {D_{tread(FAKE)}}  $$</p>
<h1 id="additional-notes">Additional notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Manual treadmills have more resistance as you need to push against the ruber, realistically you need to add extra terms but getting data for that can be a pain.</li>
<li>Air resistance is <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.1928.0012">not necessarily negligible</a>, it is directly tied to your running form, which might not be as efficient as actual runners, and it accounts for extra-effort to maintain your speed, air drag increases quandratically as you go faster (just like kinetic energy) so you can assume that the extra-effort term to compensate will to!</li>
</ul>
